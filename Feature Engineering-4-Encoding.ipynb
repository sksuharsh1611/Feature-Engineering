    "\n",
    "1. Categorical data, such as gender, color, or product category, cannot be directly used as input to machine learning algorithms, which require numerical inputs. \n",
    "   Data encoding allows us to represent categorical data as numerical values, which can be used as input to machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Text data, such as reviews, tweets, or news articles, can be transformed into numerical representations using text encoding techniques, such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, or Word2Vec. \n",
    "   These numerical representations can then be used as input to machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data encoding can help to reduce the dimensionality of the data, which can be useful for reducing computational complexity and improving model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data encoding can also be used to normalize or standardize the data, which can improve the accuracy of machine learning models by reducing the impact of differences in scale or units between features.\n",
