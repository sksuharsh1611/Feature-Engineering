# Feature Engineering Techniques
This repository contains a collection of feature engineering techniques that can be used to preprocess and transform data for machine learning applications. Feature engineering is the process of selecting and transforming data features to improve the performance of machine learning models.

The techniques covered in this repository include:

> Imputation: Handling missing data in a dataset by imputing values using various methods such as mean, median, mode, and more.

> Scaling: Rescaling numeric data to a similar scale using methods such as min-max scaling, standard scaling, and robust scaling.

> Encoding: Converting categorical data to numerical data by encoding methods such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and binary encoding.

> Feature Selection: Selecting the most important features in a dataset using techniques such as correlation-based selection, recursive feature elimination, and more.

> Feature Extraction: Extracting new features from existing features using techniques such as principal component analysis, t-SNE, and more.

> SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique is a method to balance the class distribution of data by generating synthetic data points for the minority class.

> Data Interpolation: Filling gaps or missing values in data using interpolation methods such as linear, polynomial, and cubic interpolation.

> Handling Outliers: Removing or adjusting outliers in data using methods such as Z-score, percentile-based methods, and more.


The code examples are written in Python and utilize popular libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and numpy. Each topic contains a Jupyter notebook with detailed explanations and examples of how to apply the techniques.

# Getting started
To use the code in this repository, you will need to have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. You can download and install these from the following links:

> Python 3
> Jupyter Notebook

# To run the examples, you will also need to install the following Python libraries:

pandas
scikit-learn
numpy

# You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:
> pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy

Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can open the Jupyter notebooks in each topic folder and run the code cells to see examples of how to apply the techniques.
