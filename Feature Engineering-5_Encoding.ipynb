    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for encoding categorical variables when there is a correlation between the categorical variable and the target variable. The basic idea behind this technique is to replace the labels of a categorical variable with ordinal numbers based on their relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the general steps involved in performing Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "2. Sort the categories in descending order based on their mean target value.\n",
    "3. Assign an ordinal number to each category based on its position in the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, \n",
    "Suppose you are working on a project to predict customer churn for a telecom company. \n",
    "You have a categorical variable 'Contract Type', with categories 'Month-to-month', 'One year', and 'Two year', and the target variable is 'Churn' (1 indicates churn and 0 indicates no churn). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform Target Guided Ordinal Encoding on 'Contract Type' as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean target value for each category:\n",
    "    'Month-to-month': 0.42\n",
    "    'One year': 0.12\n",
    "    'Two year': 0.03\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sort the categories in descending order based on their mean target value:\n",
    "    'Month-to-month'\n",
    "    'One year'\n",
    "    'Two year'\n",

    "3. Assign an ordinal number to each category based on its position in the sorted list:\n",
    "    'Month-to-month': 3\n",
    "    'One year': 2\n",
    "    'Two year': 1\n",
    "\n",
    "So, 'Month-to-month' gets assigned the highest ordinal number (3), followed by 'One year' (2), and 'Two year' (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding when you have a categorical variable with many categories and some of them have a strong correlation with the target variable. \n",
    "In such cases, you may not want to use One-Hot Encoding, as it will create too many new features and make the model more complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding will reduce the number of features while preserving the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable."
